# Random Pokemon Generator App
  
     Decided I would get some more practice working with APIs, so I made this
  I actully really enjoyed building this project. Added some minor stylings 
  so it wasn't just barebones. Was really more focused on the actually functionality of the app. 
  My goal was to have randomly select an object from the pokemon API and render it on the page, which 
  I was successful in doing. Learned a lot about states, hooks, and using databases.
 
 ## What I Used --> Axios, React, Javascript, CSS, HTML
